# BasicVisionExample (wpilibPi) - Discontinued
 Basic Vision Example from WPIDocs

This is an example of a basic vision setup that posts the targetâ€™s location in the aiming coordinate system described here to NetworkTables, and uses CameraServer to display a bounding rectangle of the contour detected. This example will display the framerate of the processing code on the images sent to CameraServer.

Extracted the original code from:
https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vision-processing/wpilibpi/basic-vision-example.html

NOTE:
There might be some caliberations, tests, researches and even noticeable changes to this file. Following the wpilib.org link above is compulsive for those who want to start vision from scratch!
